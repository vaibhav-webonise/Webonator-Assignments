Trainer name: Parikshit deshpande
Trainee name: Vaibhav anasune

Requirements: 
System must have JDK installed in it to run .java file.

Some basics of program:

Perimeter of regular polygon: number of sides*length of side
Perimeter of irregular polygon: addition of length of all sides

Flow of program:
1. You will be asked to choose for regular or irregular polygon
2. You have to enter number of sides of polygon
3. You will have two options 1.perimeter 2. Addition of interior angles
4. Choose one
5. If you choose regular polygon enter length of a side and degrees of angles same to the number of side
6. If you choose irregular polygon enter length of each side and degrees of angles same to the number of side

Execution of program:

Run these commands on terminal
1. Javac PolygonProperties.java
2. Java PolygonProperties
